    "My name is Jeff Mostyn. I'm a career software engineer and hobbyist game developer, working currently as a Frontend Engineer at Comcast in Philadelphia, a position I have held for four and a half years. In 2019 I graduated Drexel University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a concentration in Game Programming, and am currently enrolled part-time in a master's degree program at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Computer Graphics & Game Technology. Across my experience, I have defined myself by my ability to work alongside people of any discipline and help elevate the production of everyone involved."
